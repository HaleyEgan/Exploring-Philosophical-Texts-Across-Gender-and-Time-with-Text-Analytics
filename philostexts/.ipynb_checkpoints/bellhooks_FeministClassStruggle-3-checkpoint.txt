Feminist Class Struggle 


Class difference and the way in which it divides women was an issue women 
in the feminist movement talked about long before race. In the mostly white 
circles of a newly formed women's liberation movement the most glaring separa- 
tion between women was that of class. White working-class women recognized 
that class hierarchies were present in the movement. Conflict arose between the 
reformist vision of women's liberation which basically demanded equal rights 
for women within the existing class structure, and more radical and/or revo- 
lutionary models, which called for a fundamental change in the existing struc- 
ture so that models of mutuality and equality could replace the old paradigms. 
However, as the feminist movement progressed and privileged groups of well- 
educated white women began to achieve equal access to class power with their 
male counterparts, feminist class struggle 

From the onset of the movement women from privileged classes were able 
to make their concerns "the" issue that should be focused on in part because 
they were the group of women who received public attention. They attracted 
mass media. The issues that were most relevant to working women were never 
highlighted by mainstream mass media. Betty Friedan's The Feminist Mystique 
identified "the problem that has no name" as the dissatisfaction females felt 
about being confined and subordinated in the home as housewives. While this 
issue was presented as a crisis for women, it really was only a crisis for a small 
group of well-educated white women. While they were complaining about the 
dangers of confinement in the home a huge majority of women in the nation 
were in the workforce. And many of these working women, who put in long 
hours for low wages while still doing all the work in the domestic household 
would have seen the right to stay home as "freedom". 

It was not gender discrimination or sexist oppression that kept privileged 
women of all races from working outside the home, it was the fact that the jobs 
that would have been available to them would have been the same low-paying 
unskilled labor open to all working women. Elite groups of highly educated 
females stayed at home rather than do the type of work large numbers of lower- 
middle class and working class women were doing. Occasionally, a few of these 
women defied convention and worked outside the home performing tasks way 
below their educational skills and facing resistance from husbands and family. It 
was this resistance that turned the issue of their working outside the home into 
an issue of gender discrimination and made opposing patriarchy and seeking 
equal rights with men of their class the political platform that chose feminism 
rather than class struggle. 

From the onset, reformist white women with class priviledge were well aware 
that the power and freedom they wanted was the freedom they perceived men 
of their class enjoying. Their resistance to patriarchal male domination in the 
domestic household provided them with a connection they could use to unite 
across class with other women who were weary of male domination. But only 
privileged women had the luxury to imagine working outside the home would 
actually provide them with an income which would enable them to be econom- 
ically self-sufficient. Working class women already knew that the wages they 
received would not liberate them. 

Reformist efforts on the part of privileged groups of women to change the 
workforce so that women workers would be paid more and face less gender-based 
discrimination and harrassmcnt on the job had positive impact on the lives of 
all women. And these gains are important. Yet the fact that privileged women 
gained in class power while masses of women still do not receive wage equity 
with men is an indication of the way in which class interests superceded feminist 
efforts to change the workforce so that women would receive equal pay for equal 
work. 

Lesbian feminist thinkers were among the first activists to raise the issue 
of class in the feminst movement, expressing their viewpoints in an accessible 
language. They were a group of women who had not imagined they could 
depend on husbands to support them. And they were often much more aware 
than their straight counterparts of the difficulties all women would face in the 
workforce. In the early 1970s, anthologies like Class and Feminism, edited by 
Charlotte Bunch and Nancy Myron, published work written by women from 
diverse backgrounds who were confronting the issue in feminist circles. Each 
essay emphasized the fact that class was not simply a question of money. In 
The Last Straw, Rita Mae Brown (who was not a famous writer at the time) 
clearly stated: 

"Class is much more than Marx's definition of relationship to the means of 
production. Class involves your behavior, your basic assumptions, how you are 
taught to behave, what you expect from yourself and from others, your concept 
of a future, how you understand problems and solve them, how you think, feel, 
act." 

These women who entered feminist groups, made up of diverse classes, were 
among the first to see that the vision of a politically based sisterhood where 
all females would unite together to fight patriarchy could not emerge until the 
issue of class was confronted. 

Placing class on feminist agendas opened up the space where the intersec- 
tions of class and race were made apparent. Within the institutionalized race, 
sex, class social system in our society black females were clearly at the bottom 
of the economic totem pole. Initially well-educated white women from working 
class backgrounds were more visible than black females of all classes in the fem- 
inist movement. They were a minority within the movement, but theirs was the 
voice of experience. They knew better than their priviledged class comrades of 
any race the costs of resisting race, class and gender domination. They knew 
what it was like to struggle to change one's economic situation. Between them 
and their privileged-class comrades there were ongoing conflicts over appropriate 
behavior, over the issues that would be presented as fundamental feminist con- 
cerns. Within the feminst movement women from privileged class backgrounds 
who had never before been involved in leftist freedom fighting learned the con- 
crete politics of class struggle, confronting challenges made by less privileged 
women, and also learning in the process assertiveness skills and constructive 
ways to cope with conflict. Despite constructive intervention, many privileged 
white women continued to act as though feminism belonged to them, as though 
they were in charge. 

Mainstream patriarchy reinforced the idea that the concerns of women from 
privileged class groups were the only ones worthy of receiving attention. Fem- 
inist reform aimed to gain social equality for women within the existing struc- 
ture. Privileged women wanted equality with men of their class. Despite sex- 
ism among their class they would not have wanted to have the lot of working 
class men. Feminist efforts to grant women social equality with men of their 
class neatly coincided with white supremacist-capitalist-patriarchal fears that 
white power would diminish if non-white people gained equal access to economic 
power and priviledge. Supporting what in effect became white powcr-reformist- 
fcminism enabled the mainstream white supremacist patriarchy to bolster its 
power while simultaneously undermining the radical politics of feminism. 

Only revolutionary feminist thinkers expressed outrage at this co-optation 
of the feminist movement. Our critique and outrage gained a hearing in the 
alternative press. In her collection of essays, The Coming of Black Genocide, 
radical white activist Mary Barfoot boldly stated: 

"There are white women, hurt and angry, who believed that the '70s women's 
movement meant sisterhood, and who feel betrayed by escalator women. By 
women who went back home to patriarchy. But the women's movement never 
left the father Dick's side. There was no war. And there was no liberation. We 
got a share of the genocide profits and we love it. We are Sisters of Patriarchy, 
and true supporters of national and class oppression, Patriarchy in its highest 
form is Euro-imperialism on a worldscale. If we're Dick's sister and want what 
he has gotten, then in the end we support that system that he got it all from." 

Indeed, many more feminist women found and find it easier to consider 
divesting of white supremacist thinking than of their class elitism. 

As privileged women gained greater access to economic power with men of 
their class, feminist discussions of class were no longer commonplace. Instead, 
all women were encouraged to see the economic gains of affluent females as a 
positive sign for all women. In actuality, these gains rarely changed the lot of 
poor and working class women. And since privileged men did not become equal 
caretakers in the domestic household, the freedom of privileged-class women of 
all races has required the sustained subordination of working class and poor 
women. In the 1990s, collusion with the existing social structure was the price 
of "women's liberation." At the end of the day class power proved to be more 
important than feminism. And this collusion helped de-stablizc the feminist 
movement. 

When women acquired greater class status and power without conducting 
themselves differently from males feminist politics were undermined. Lots of 
women felt betrayed. Middle- and lower-middle class women who were sud- 
denly compelled by the ethos of feminism to enter the workforce did not feel 
liberated once they faced the hard truth that working outside the home did not 
mean work in the home would be equally shared with male partners. No-fault 
divorce proved to be more economically beneficial to men than women. As 
many black women/ women of color saw white women from privileged classes 
benefiting economically more than other groups from reformist feminist gains, 
from gender being tacked on to racial affirmative action, it simply reaffirmed 
their fear that feminism was really about increasing white power. The most 
profound betrayal of feminist issues has been the lack of mass-based feminist 
protest challenging the government's assault on single mothers and the disman- 
tling of the welfare system. Privileged women, many of whom call themselves 
feminists, have simply turned away from the "feminization of poverty". 

The only genuine hope of feminist liberation lies with a vision of social change 
which challenges class elitism. Western women have gained class power and 
greater gender inequality because a global white supremacist patriarchy enslaves 
and/or subordinates masses of third world women. In this country, the combined 
forces of a booming prison industry and workfare-oriented welfare in conjuction 
with conservative immigration policy create and condone the conditions for 
indentured slavery. Ending welfare will create a new underclass of women and 
children to be abused and exploited by the existing structures of domination. 

Given the changing realities of class in our nation, widening gaps between the 
rich and poor, and the continued feminization of poverty, we desperately need a 
mass-based radical feminist movement that can build on the strength of the past, 
including the positive gains generated by reforms, while offering meaningful 
interrogation of existing feminist theory that was simply wrongminded while 
offering us new strategies. Significantly, a visionary movement would ground its 
work in the concrete conditions of the working class and poor women.
